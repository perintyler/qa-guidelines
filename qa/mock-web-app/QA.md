# QA: mock-web-app

A todo list web app with an HTML frontend and JSON API. Zero dependencies — just Node.

## Requirements

- `node` (v18+)
- Playwright MCP server

## Setup

1. Start the server: `node qa/mock-web-app/server.js &`
2. Wait for "Todo app listening" message

## Test Steps

Use the Playwright MCP server to perform all browser interactions and API calls.

### 1. Server starts and responds

Navigate to http://localhost:9876/health

**Expected:** Page loads successfully with JSON containing `"status": "ok"`

### 2. Homepage serves HTML

Navigate to http://localhost:9876/

**Expected:** Page title is "Todo App"

### 3. Homepage has a form

On the homepage, look for the add todo form.

**Expected:** Form with id "add-form" is visible

### 4. Todo list starts empty

Check that no todos are displayed initially.

**Expected:** Todo list is empty

### 5. Create a todo

Use the form to add a todo with title "Buy milk".

**Expected:** Todo "Buy milk" appears in the list

### 6. Toggle todo done

Click the toggle/checkbox button on the "Buy milk" todo to mark it as done.

**Expected:** Todo shows as completed/done

### 7. Delete todo

Click the delete button on the "Buy milk" todo.

**Expected:** Todo is removed from the list

### 8. List is empty after delete

Verify the todo list is empty again.

**Expected:** No todos displayed

### 9. Invalid create returns error

Try to submit the form with an empty title.

**Expected:** Error message or validation prevents submission

### 10. Not found handling

Navigate to http://localhost:9876/api/todos/999

**Expected:** 404 response or "Not found" message

```bash
kill $(lsof -ti:9876) 2>/dev/null || true
```

- [ ] Server starts and health check responds
- [ ] Homepage serves HTML with form
